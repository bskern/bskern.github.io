I am currently a software architect for Slalom.I have been in consulting roles for most of my career and I think what keeps me there is that I enjoy all the
different businesses, industries, software stacks, and problems I get to solve.
I started my career doing Java development and transitionted over time into many languages on the JVM, Javascript, and some ios work.
I really enjoy functional languages and functional programming and if I had full control over software stack I would gravitate that way as long as it made sense.
Feel free to contact me at any of the outlets listed I am always open to hearing about new opportunites/networking/working together on projects.  Outside of technoogy and programming
I love spending time with my wife and kids and playing golf.
