I am currently a software architect for Slalom. I have been in consulting roles for most of my career and I think what keeps me there is that I enjoy all the
different businesses, industries, software stacks, and problems I get to solve.
 I started my career doing Java development and transitioned over time into many languages on the JVM,a couple non-JVM languages, Javascript, and some ios work.
I really enjoy functional languages and functional programming and if I had full control over software stack I would gravitate that way as long as it made sense.
Feel free to contact me I am always open to hearing about new opportunites/networking/working together on projects.  Outside of technology and programming
I love spending time with my wife and kids and playing golf.
